"""Overdraft family — concrete `Invariant` + `ViolationGenerator` impls.

`OverdraftInvariant` fires when an internal account's stored balance
goes negative. The matview is a one-line filter on
``<prefix>_current_daily_balances`` — no leg arithmetic, no parent
dependency, no role join. Structurally the simplest L1 invariant after
drift.

The AU.0 spike (``tests/unit/test_au0_overdraft_full_spine.py``) caught
a real finding: an overdraft planted on a LEAF internal account ALSO
trips `DriftInvariant`. Mechanism — drift's matview filter is
``parent_role IS NOT NULL`` AND ``stored ≠ Σ posted legs``. The
overdraft plant satisfies both (the leaf has a parent_role; the plant
emits stored=−magnitude with ZERO transactions, so Σ legs = 0 ≠
−magnitude). The edge falls out of overlapping base-table predicates
between two independent matview SELECTs — it's not drift-specific
exotica.

So AU.1's `INVARIANT_GENERATOR_EDGES` entry for `OverdraftGenerator` is
``(OverdraftInvariant, DriftInvariant)``: two edges, same shape as
drift's `(DriftInvariant, LedgerDriftInvariant)`.

What this module deliberately does NOT carry:

- An `rng` field on `OverdraftGenerator`. Overdraft's emission is fully
  determined by construction params (one balance row, magnitude scalar);
  no randomization surface. Drift accepts `rng` for structural
  uniformity across the spine; overdraft has no use for it. AT's anomaly
  generator will actually use the RNG.
- A stateful day-by-day fold. Overdraft is a single-row witness; no
  carried state across days; the `AccountSimulation` AS.3 base class is
  for invariants with running balance.
- Cross-account composition (AS.4's `LedgerSimulation`). Overdraft is
  per-account; AU.2's composition test wires it into a LedgerSimulation
  alongside DriftGenerator for the spine-scales-past-one-invariant gate.
